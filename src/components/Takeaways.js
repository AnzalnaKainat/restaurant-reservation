            The website leaves users with the sense that their needs are truly taken into account
            <br /><br />
            One quote from peer feedback:
            <i>"Using this website feels like it was thoughtfully designed with users in mind. The intuitive and well-planned features stand out."</i>

          <h4>What I learned</h4>
          <p>
            While designing the Restaurant Reservation website design, I learned that the first ideas for
            the designs are only the beginning of the process. Usability studies and peer feedback influenced
            each iteration of the web designsâ€‹
